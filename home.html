			<u><h2>Titan</h2></u>
			<br/>
			<p>Titan is a stack based programming language. It is still under active development currently in version 1.0.<br/>
			The language features many advances features such as conditional programming; such as if and else statements. The language can support user written functions, and libraries in a future build. The interpreter was written in C# and has an estimate 2k lines powering it, although every update drastically changes that. Functions are also to play a larger part of the language in a future build.</p>
